        <p><a name="project"></a><strong>The Project</strong><br> This
          is an ongoing effort co-sponsored by Manuscripts, Archives
          and Rare Books Library(MARBL) and the Louis H. Beck Center
          for Electronic Collections and Services, Woodruff Library,
          Emory University.<br>
          <br>
          The goal of this project was to digitize a coherent number
          of the 3000 texts contained in the French Revolution
          Pamphlet Collection held by Manuscripts, Archives and Rare
          Books Library. It is hoped that the digital collection,
          which will eventually display 89 literary and satirical
          pamphlets, will highlight what had been a nearly invisible
          library resource and will facilitate scholarly access to
          archival texts that have not been widely reproduced.<br>
          <br>
          The technical aspects of the digitization process involve scanning the 
          original documents using high-end digital photography, converting them 
          to text format documents with optical-character-reading software, proofreading, 
          and finally, sgml mark-up in order to provide a web-based interface 
          which allows full document retrieval as well as extensive cross-text 
          search capabilities.</p>

          3.)<a name="1foot" href="#foot1" class="footnote"

        <p>The pamphlet is a genre of literary engagement. From the 5000 or so 
          <em>Mazarinades</em> that were written during the Fronde uprising, to 
          the pamphlets of the Revolution, to the pamphlet literature inspired 
          by the issues leading to the events of May 1968, the pamphlet in France 
          has existed as the genre most readily adopted by partisans complicit 
          in a political or social crisis.<a name="2foot" href="#foot2" class="footnote"
onMouseOver="overlib('While Emory has some 3000 of these, other U.S. libraries have catalogued up to 30,000 in their collections, and still more are held by the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale and other French archives. Harvey Chisick has estimated that perhaps 70 to 80 thousand pamphlets were produced during the revolutionary period. Harvey Chisick, &quot;Special Issue: Pamplet Literature of the French Revolution,&quot; <em>History of European Ideas</em> 17, March/May (1993): 152.', CAPTION, 'Footnote 2', WIDTH, 300)"
onMouseOut="nd()">2</a> Theorizing the genre is an extremely difficult 
          task, as several closely related forms (satire, polemic, parody and 
          pastiche among others) create a fluid grouping that categorizes &#8220;une 
          litt&eacute;rature de combat.&#8221;<a name="3foot" href="#foot3" class="footnote"
onMouseOver="overlib('Marc Angenot, <em>La Parole Pamphl&eacute;taire : Contribution &Agrave; La Typologie Des Discours Modernes</em> (Paris: Payot, 1982) &quot;Introduction,&quot; and Chisick, &quot;Special Issue: Pamplet Literature of the French Revolution,&quot; 149-50.', CAPTION, 'Footnote 3', WIDTH, 300)"
onMouseOut="nd()">3</a> Yet one must still answer the question raised 
          in the passage above: &#8220;Que c&#8217;&eacute;toit-ce donc?&#8221; 
          The passage marvelously encapsulates the effort at definition that any 
          introduction to this collection would have to make. Working through 
          <em>une lecture, une trag&eacute;die, un po&euml;me &eacute;pique</em>&#8230;, 
          the author attempts to locate what one might call a text-based event. 
          In naming various genres and then alluding to the relation of appearance 
          and reality (a theme with a very specific eighteenth-century response), 
          one might think the passage was written precisely to describe the genre 
          of pamphlet literature. Although the passage levels more of an aesthetic 
          judgment (one based ultimately on entertainment value), it does touch 
          upon all the aspects of the genre: its versatility, its public nature, 
          its polemical character, and its existence in the spheres of both representation 
          and public opinion.<a name="4foot" href="#foot4" class="footnote"
onMouseOver="overlib('Chantal Thomas has argued that to fully appreciate the pamphlet genre we have to take into account the noisy, public atmosphere of their reception, as many were publicly read aloud. Chantal Thomas, &quot;L&#8217;heroine Du Crime: Marie-Antoinette Dans Les Pamphlets,&quot; <em>La Carmagnole Des Muses: L&#8217;homme De Lettres Et L&#8217;artiste Dans La Revolution</em>, ed. Jean-Claude Bonnet, Lib. du Bicentenaire de la Revolution Fr. ed. (Place of Publication: Paris, 1988).', CAPTION, 'Footnote 4', WIDTH, 300)"
onMouseOut="nd()">4</a> The pamphlets in Emory&#8217;s collection exhibit 
          all these characteristics as revealed by a quick inventory of the various 
          subgenres.</p>
        <p>In terms of strict genre, 27 of the 89 &#8220;literary&#8221; pamphlets 
          can be considered <em>pi&egrave;ces</em>. The texts either refer to 
          themselves as <em>drame, trag&eacute;die, com&eacute;die</em> (or some 
          combination: <em>tragi-politi-comique, h&eacute;roi-tragi-com&eacute;die</em>&#8230;) 
          or make another theatrical reference strong enough to label them as 
          such. The theatre of the revolution can be considered a discrete subject, 
          and some of these <em>pi&egrave;ces</em> are better known works like 
          Marie-Joseph Ch&eacute;nier&#8217;s <em>Charles IX</em>, which generated 
          much controversy over the state&#8217;s use of censorship, or the violent, 
          anti-jacobinist works, <em>L'int&eacute;rieur des comit&eacute;s r&eacute;volutionnaires</em> 
          by Pierre Ducancel and <em>L&#8217;Ami des lois</em> by J.L. Laya.<a name="5foot" href="#foot5" class="footnote"
onMouseOver="overlib('Marvin A. Carlson, <em>The Theatre of the French Revolution</em> (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1966) 21, 232, 143.', CAPTION, 'Footnote 5', WIDTH, 300)"
onMouseOut="nd()">5</a> If the theatrical status of the <em>Sc&egrave;ne 
          comique entre le diable et un procureur</em> might seem untenable due 
          to its length (8 pages) and the political cant in its title, a blatant 
          political message marks most all of these plays. They run the political 
          spectrum, with lines reading &#8220;Tr&ocirc;ne d&#8217;Henri IV &amp; 
          de Louis XIV, tu seras &agrave; jamais in&eacute;branlable!&#8221; to 
          &#8220;Toujours r&eacute;primand&eacute;!&#8230; Ma foi je n&#8217;y 
          tiens plus. Quel ton! Vit-on jamais d&#8217;ordres plus absolus?&#8221;<a name="6foot" href="#foot6" class="footnote"
onMouseOver="overlib('Respectively from <em>La Cour pl&eacute;ni&egrave;re</em>, p. 75 and <em>La veuve du r&eacute;publicain</em>, p. 7.', CAPTION, 'Footnote 6', WIDTH, 300)"
onMouseOut="nd()">6</a></p>
        <p>A rubric entitled <em>po&egrave;me</em> might include fourteen of the 
          pamphlets, the keywords being <em>po&egrave;me, chanson, hyme, ode</em>. 
          Laura Mason argues that song was one of the most common forms of communication 
          during the French revolution, and she creates a striking tableau: Paris, 
          &#8220;a city that encompassed a cacophony of voices as revolutionaries 
          and royalists filled streets, theaters, and caf&eacute;s, organizing 
          festivals, giving speeches, rioting and, throughout all, singing.&#8221;<a name="7foot" href="#foot7" class="footnote"
onMouseOver="overlib('Laura Mason, <em>Singing the French Revolution : Popular Culture and Politics, 1787-1799</em> (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996) 2.', CAPTION, 'Footnote 7', WIDTH, 300)"
onMouseOut="nd()">7</a> Again, this grouping also manifests the elements 
          which characterize the pamphlet genre. The vitriolic poem <em>Les Crimes 
          de Paris</em> attacks Mirabeau and Laclos among others in perfectly 
          rhymed couplets. The <em>Chanson d'un sans-culotte</em> borrows from 
          the well-known <em>La Carmagnole</em> to narrate another military exploit, 
          the fall of Toulon. The tune of a children&#8217;s nursery rhyme is 
          used to celebrate the death of Robespierre in <em>La Jacobini&egrave;re 
          en d&eacute;route</em>. </p>
        <p>Another fourteen pamphlets make an explicit allusion to a religious 
          form (<em>cat&eacute;chisme, &eacute;p&icirc;tre, pri&egrave;re, oraison</em>). 
          Most use the form as a satirical vehicle (recalling the normal public 
          nature of these addresses), like <em>Messe du 14 juillet 1790</em>, 
          which purports to recount the drunken abbot Maury imagining himself 
          giving mass. The remaining 34 include a vast variety of forms: <em>opuscule, 
          credo, lettre, adresse</em>, etc., Although not all of them make reference 
          to a specific form, the allusions to form serve as intertextual markers, 
          deployed by the authors to make their case. It is the intent to persuade 
          which informs most of these pamphlets. A wonderful example of this is 
          the <em>Nouveau Dictionnaire Fran&ccedil;ois&#8230;compos&eacute; par 
          un Aristocrat</em>, which defines the very term &#8220;aristocrat&#8221; 
          as &#8220;L&#8217;homme qui d&eacute;pla&icirc;t ou qu&#8217;on craint.&#8221; 
          Despite the pamphlet genre&#8217;s polemical nature, an element of humor 
          often underlies even the most violent attacks. The <em>Nouveau Dictionnaire</em> 
          does not hesitate to inscribe on its title page the ironic retort to 
          the entire document&#8217;s perversion of genre. The epigram reads: 
          &#8220;Et c&#8217;est la v&eacute;rit&eacute;, comme on dit, toute nue.&#8221;</p>
        <p>I have touched upon only one aspect of these pamphlets, genre, yet 
          there are of course many more questions to ask of our collection. Although 
          limited, one avenue might be the intertextual relation within the collection. 
          Three texts respectively entitled <em>Grande m&eacute;nagerie des animaux 
          vivans&#8230;</em>, <em>Description de la m&eacute;nagerie royale d'animaux 
          vivans&#8230;</em> and <em>Description et vente curieuse des animaux 
          f&eacute;roces</em> (which contains such beasts as the <em>simia jacobina</em>), 
          allude to a specific public event. A different path of inquiry, again 
          using the entire collection, concerns the publishing patterns of these 
          pamphlets. Rarely do these pamphlets list the same publisher. How do 
          these pamphlets fit into publishing trends of the era? What are the 
          histories of these particular publishers? Why is the typographical use 
          of signature (the letters at the bottom of the page used in the printing 
          layout process) somewhat erratic? What was the state of copyright law 
          under the new Republic (see the note addressing the issue of copyright 
          on page 2 of <em>La veuve du r&eacute;publicain&#8230;</em>)? Another 
          question for the entire collection might be the one raised by Harvey 
          Chisick. Regarding the status of language in these pamphlets, how do 
          they fit (or not fit) into what he argues is a fundamental shift in 
          the mode of discourse that takes place between 1789 and 1792, from the 
          art of persuasion which characterized the open, dialogic mode of the 
          Enlightenment to a discourse of denunciation and condemnation?<a name="8foot" href="#foot8" class="footnote"
onMouseOver="overlib('Harvey Chisick, &quot;Introduction to Edition Entitled &quot;the Press in the French Revolution&quot;,&quot; <em>Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century</em> 287 (1991): 8-9.', CAPTION, 'Footnote 8', WIDTH, 300)"
onMouseOut="nd()">8</a> One might also study the images associated 
          with these texts. The pamphlet entitled <em>Purgatif de la magistrature 
          ou la r&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;ration des tribunaux</em> opens with 
          a delightful engraving.<a name="9foot" href="#foot9" class="footnote"
onMouseOver="overlib('This pamphlet is listed neither in RLIN nor in Gallica, although it is listed in Martin and Walter with the same bibliographic information as Emory&#8217;s pamphlet.', CAPTION, 'Footnote 9', WIDTH, 300)"
onMouseOut="nd()">9</a> </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/purgat2.jpg" width="400" height="165"></p>
        <p>As individual works the pamphlets also merit attention. Are they more 
          worthy as literary works or as historical documents? How do these pamphlets 
          function as literary texts? How do they utilize or confound genre? What 
          may be said about the chansons, hymnes and odes?<a name="10foot" href="#foot10" class="footnote"
onMouseOver="overlib('See Richet on orality in the volume edited by Chisick, Chantal Thomas&#8217; article cited above, and Laura Mason&#8217;s <em>Singing the French Revolution</em>.', CAPTION, 'Footnote 10', WIDTH, 300)"
onMouseOut="nd()">10</a> What kinds of allusions do they make? On this 
          latter point, a specific question with import across several texts would 
          aim at the geneology of the lanterne found in three of these pamphlets: 
          <em>La lanterne magique patriotique&#8230;</em>; <em>Les grandes marionnettes 
          r&eacute;publicaines, suivies de la fameuse lanterne magique &#8230;</em>; 
          <em>Prieres pour les aristocrates agonisans &#8230;et les litanies de 
          la lanterne</em>. This of course raises the question of history. Who 
          were these authors? Who are the historical persons who populate these 
          texts? If Loustalot and l'abb&eacute; Royou are arguing over freedom 
          of the press, and Marat and Verginiaux over federalism, what were the 
          particular historical circumstances which provoked these pamphlets?<a name="11foot" href="#foot11" class="footnote"
onMouseOver="overlib('See the pamphlet entitled <em>Dialogue des morts de la r&eacute;volution&#8230;</em>.', CAPTION, 'Footnote 11', WIDTH, 300)"
onMouseOut="nd()">11</a> How did these pamphlets participate in or 
          reflect the Revolution?</p>
        <p>There are of course other ways of defining the collection. The pamphlets 
          do fall into a rough temporal division:</p>

        <p>While this sample of pamphlets is too small to make any generalizations 
          about, for example, the publishing output during the Revolution, it 
          does help to contextualize these texts, most all of which are exceedingly 
          specific in regards to contemporary events. The pamphlets are also physical 
          objects, and have thus been institutionally defined. As historical objects 
          in an archive, the pamphlets have undergone material changes. The Woodruff 
          Library, in a very practical manner, decided in 1949 to bind most of 
          this heteroclite collection of pamphlets, thus imposing a physical order 
          of proximity, an order related to the ease of shelving, finding and 
          handling, upon the collection.<a name="13foot" href="#foot13" class="footnote"

onMouseOut="nd()">14</a> The modern curator must consider yet another 
          practical aspect which defines these texts: their availability. The 
          current trend of making archive material available online in digital 
          format imposes a order of priority in regard to the task of producing 
          a digital version of these texts. Of the 89 pamphlets, 51 are available 
          on <a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/">Gallica</a> (the French National 
          Library's digital site) -- the vast majority of the Gallica pamphlets 
          are in .pdf format, which does not allow for searching across pages, 
          nor across documents.<a name="15foot" href="#foot15" class="footnote"

onMouseOut="nd()">15</a> The 38 pamphlets that are not available through

          list.</p>
        <p>The organizational requirements and the transformation of these pamphlets 
          from loose-leaf to digital hypertext have not, however, changed the 
          content. The pamphlets still demand to be read, interpreted and enjoyed 
          as literary texts. This brief introduction to the collection can only 
          outline some of the issues raised by these works, issues both literary 
          and historical. Yet hopefully it will inspire future researchers to 
          engage these pamphlets so rich in material. May the erudite and the 
          sleuth both be welcomed, and may their intellectual voyages find healthy 
          fruit.</p>

          indicate that this is a half title. The full title of their entries 
          reads &quot;R&eacute;ponse &agrave;...&quot; and &quot;Seconde r&eacute;ponse

          of these, other U.S. libraries have catalogued up to 30,000 in their 
          collections, and still more are held by the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale 
          and other French archives. Harvey Chisick has estimated that perhaps 
          70 to 80 thousand pamphlets were produced during the revolutionary period.

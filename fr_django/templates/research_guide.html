      <p><b><a name="prov"></a>Provenance</b>:</p>
      <p>The library purchased the collection in 1949.
      	In January, 1949, one batch of 1500 was purchased from England.
	391 duplicates were sold to the Univ. 
        of Alabama. (1)  892 were 
        catalogued as a group, 30 were catalogued individually.
	After January two more batches were purchased: a group of 300 
        titles and a group of 2,000+ (of this latter group, were some 500 duplicates???). 
        (2) It appears, judging from 
        a bindery receipt found in volume 112, that the volumes were bound in 
        Atlanta by the National Library Bindery Co. (2395 Peachtree Rd.).</p>
